# Terning
This is a Java program for rolling dice.
The program has known errors. 

## Purpose
This is an exercise in using github to fix errors and trace the changes.

# Contents
This project contains source code for the die rolling program and a JUnit test that tests different aspects of the program. For example, the test tries to roll the die 60.000 times to see if we get expected random results.
A branch called BugFixes contains code for a working version of the program. This branch is later merged to the master-branch.
